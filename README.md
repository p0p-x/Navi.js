<h5>Current Version: <strong>v1.6.0</strong></h5>
<strong>Minor Updated: Made animation slideUpLeft look better / fixed IE bug</strong>


Navi.js makes it easy to dynamically display content on your sites. Instead of cluttering up your site tree with extra files, you can easily write all of your html code for multiple pages in one file.

Navi leverages <a href="http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/">Ben Alman's hashchange plugin</a> to change content based on the current hash. This allows the use of the back button functionality, along with the ability to bookmark the pages.

Navi is also friendly with other plugins, and can be called on multiple objects or nested together.

Navi was created to be an easy way for anyone wanting to change content. This plugin can help with the development of numerous other plugins including: tabs, pagination, image sliders, and others. Navi has serveral options to tweak and allows for loading content based on the page hash. You can call Navi on multiple elements with ease so you can have multiple content switching sections.
